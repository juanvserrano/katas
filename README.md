## Goals
The goal of each kata is to improve our coding through better design decissions. 
Katas can be discussed on weekly tech catch ups.

## Doing Tasks

1. Fork this repository
2. There's no specific convention for creating files / tree structure.
3. Tasks are located in `tasks` folder. Complete tasks in order before moving to the next one.
4. You can refactor your code any time if you feel something is not working as neat as you expected.
