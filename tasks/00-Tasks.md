# Ecommerce

The UX team let us create a new amazing Ecommerce. This is possible because we're such an amazing team and we know how to style (with css modules, SASS) and code.

After some discussion, the team has decided all the features required.

We will need:

- One Card Component (to rule them all!)
- A Grid to show our products (rendered in our amazing Card component of course)
- A super basic <AmazingCart/>â„¢ 

Let's do it!
